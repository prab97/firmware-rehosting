# firmware-rehosting
This is a part of firmware analysis done at the University of Birmingham using raspberry-pi 2040. The task was divided into three parts, look for "description.txt", where in each task it was required to find flags in a particular format. The idea behind this activity was to understand the concept of SPI, UART, and firmware rehosting.
